    <h2>Organizational Structure</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Expand to 18 ALS stations, adding two new Bravo units for a total of 20 ambulances. The three new stations will be strategically placed using GIS and call volume data, with Bravo units positioned in high-call-volume sectors.</li>
        <li>Increase the number of Field Training Officers (FTOs) to 7 per shift, allowing for 1 FTO per 5 ambulances. The 5th, 6th, and 7th FTOs will act as roaming EMS supervisors, assisting on critical calls and providing training as directed.</li>
        <li>Develop an EMS Special Operations Team (Critical Care Unit) to handle high-acuity patients requiring specialized care and transportation.</li>
        <li>Expand personnel assigned to ambulances to three, including two paramedics and one EMT. This staffing model will initially target high-call-volume units and aim for system-wide implementation to enhance patient care and reduce reliance on engine crews for critical patients.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Staffing and Training</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Enhance the apprenticeship program to include a greater focus on physiology, pathophysiology, and pharmacology.</li>
        <li>Maintain a minimum of 2 EMS Training Captains and 3 EMS Training Lieutenants to oversee training programs.</li>
        <li>Offer advanced courses, such as Critical Care Paramedic, Advanced Trauma Life Support (ATLS), and Neonatal Resuscitation Program (NRP).</li>
        <li>Facilitate Hands-On Training (HOT) or scenario-based exercises to reinforce learning.</li>
        <li>Revise and improve the QA/QI process, conducting monthly meetings to address system performance and protocol adherence.</li>
        <li>Establish a Medical Guidelines Review Board to align current protocols with best practices. This board will meet monthly until the guideline revision process is complete.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Operational Efficiency</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Maintain regular scheduled lifecycle replacements for apparatus and equipment.</li>
        <li>Acquire ventilators, IV pumps, and LifePak 35s to modernize and enhance patient care capabilities.</li>
        <li>Transition to blue helmets for personnel in the Rescue Sergeant position. This will facilitate identification of lead EMS personnel on complex scenes.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Community Engagement and Feedback</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Standardize timelines for complaint investigations and resolutions, ensuring consistent and efficient handling of concerns.</li>
        <li>Establish more routine community outreach programs such as:</li>
        <ul>
            <li>School visits.</li>
            <li>Job fair booths.</li>
            <li>Informational booths at identified community events.</li>
        </ul>
    </ul>

    <h2>Financials and Sustainability</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Allocate budget for:
            <ul>
                <li>Personnel expansion.</li>
                <li>Training and education.</li>
                <li>Technological upgrades.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Future Challenges and Goals Beyond 5 Years</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>To be determined.</li>
    </ul>


    <h2>Summary</h2>
    <p>Over the next five years, the EMS system aims to evolve into a more robust, efficient, and community-focused organization. By expanding stations, enhancing training, and improving operational efficiency, the system will address current challenges and meet growing demands. These advancements will ensure high-quality emergency medical services while fostering resilience and adaptability for the future.</p>

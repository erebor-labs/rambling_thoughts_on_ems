    <p>The structure of our current Emergency Medical Services (EMS) system is as follows:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>15 Ambulances:</strong></li>
    <ul>
        <li>These ambulances are staffed using a dual-medic configuration. A Sergeant acts as the lead medic on each unit.</li>
        <li>Sergeants assigned to ambulances typically have 3-5 years of field experience. They are often paired with personnel who are either newly hired or recently certified as paramedics, providing an opportunity for mentoring and skill development.</li>
    </ul>
    <li><strong>4 Field Training Officers (FTOs) Per Shift:</strong></li>
    <ul>
        <li>The FTOs are responsible for evaluating and training newly certified paramedics, ensuring they meet the department's performance and clinical standards.</li>
        <li>They also oversee Quality Assurance and Quality Improvement (QA/QI) initiatives to maintain high standards of patient care and operational efficiency.</li>
    </ul>
</ul>
<p>These elements work together to form the backbone of our EMS operations, ensuring readiness, reliability, and continuous professional development.</p>

    <h2 style="margin-top: 50px;">Organizational Structure</h2>
    <p>The fire rescue organization operates on a three-shift schedule: A, B, and C shifts, where personnel work 24 hours on and 48 hours off. The system includes 15 ALS ambulances, each stationed at one of the 15 fire stations, with a 16th Bravo unit planned for Station 01. Each ambulance is staffed by two paramedics, one serving as the Rescue Sergeant, the lead medic.</p>
    <p>There are also 4 Field Training Officers (FTOs) per shift, who manage the Quality Assurance/Quality Improvement (QA/QI) process and field training. FTOs report to an EMS Training Lieutenant, who reports to an EMS Training Captain, ultimately under the Chief of EMS. The current organizational chart can be found <a href="current_org_chart.svg" target="_blank">here.</a></p>

    <h2>Staffing and Training</h2>
    <p>Retention loss in the EMS system is approximately 10% annually. Lead medics on ambulances average 3-5 years of experience, with the secondary medics typically being newly certified or newly hired. Newly hired employees complete a 12-month probationary paramedic task book and may choose to enter an apprentice program after successfully challenging the entrance requirements. This program allows them to work out of rank as a lead medic (provided they are off probation) and qualifies them for a $6,000 paramedic incentive pay once completed.</p>
    <p>The training department ensures paramedics are certified in ACLS and BLS. Additionally, the department offers NAEMT courses, including AMLS, PHTLS, EPC, and TECCC.</p>

    <h2>System Coverage and Performance</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Population Served:</strong> The system serves a total population of 169,795 (2023 census).</li>
        <li><strong>Coverage Area:</strong> It spans 502.5 square miles of land.</li>
        <li><strong>Mutual Aid Agreements:</strong> These are in place with Osceola County, Okeechobee County, St. Lucie County, Brevard County, and Indian River Shores.</li>
        <li><strong>Response Time Challenges:</strong>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Highways:</strong> I-95 and the Florida Turnpike.</li>
                <li><strong>Outlying areas:</strong> Fellsmere.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Call Volume:</strong> The system handles an average of 31,539 calls annually.</li>
        <li><strong>Transport Times:</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>Average transport time: 10.66 minutes.</li>
                <li>Extended transport time for specialty trauma centers: 23.79 minutes.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Operational Efficiency</h2>
    <h3>Dispatch and Technology</h3>
    <p>The system utilizes <strong>Enterprise Fire Mobile</strong> from <strong>Tyler Technologies</strong> for dispatch and call routing. This system is equipped with GPS and is designed to identify the closest available unit to prioritize response times. However, there are concerns about the full functionality of the system, and it is currently unknown if it is working appropriately in all cases.</p>

    <h3>Equipment Maintenance</h3>
    <p>Regular maintenance is performed on ambulances by the fleet management team. Medical equipment is maintained as needed and according to the manufacturer's recommendations to ensure that all equipment is in optimal working condition.</p>

    <h2>Quality Assurance/Quality Improvement (QA/QI) Process</h2>
    <p>The QA/QI process ensures high standards of patient care and is divided into three levels:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>QA/QI Level I (Rescue Sergeant):</strong> Reviews medical reports at the station each shift, addresses documentation errors, and forwards protocol infractions to FTOs. Supervises and documents Training Action Plans (TAPs) for identified errors or infractions.</li>
        <li><strong>QA/QI Level II (FTO):</strong> Reviews high-acuity reports, develops TAPs for errors or infractions, coordinates TAP implementation with station officers and Rescue Sergeants, and escalates severe protocol infractions to the Medical Review Board (MRB).</li>
        <li><strong>QA/QI Level III (Medical Review Board):</strong> Reviews cases involving high-acuity calls, protocol infractions, or neglect, prescribes TAPs, including comprehensive refresher training (up to five shifts), and refers rule violations to Fire Department Administration as needed.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Community Engagement and Feedback</h2>
    <h3>Public Relations</h3>
    <p>Public education programs are currently limited or non-existent. The department occasionally offers school visits, station tours, and community CPR classes, but these services are provided only upon request. There is no active, ongoing outreach program in place at this time.</p>

    <h3>Complaint Resolution</h3>
    <p>There is no formally identified complaint resolution process or protocol for addressing concerns about patient care. Feedback from patients and the community is reviewed on an ad-hoc basis, but there is no standardized approach for managing complaints or ensuring consistent resolution.</p>

    <h2>Financials and Sustainability</h2>
    <h3>Funding Sources</h3>
    <p>The EMS system is primarily funded through a combination of taxes, billing, and grants. There may be budget constraints that impact operations or future growth, but the department works diligently to ensure adequate funding for high-priority areas, including staffing, equipment, and training.</p>

    <h3>Cost of Service</h3>
    <p>Patient billing and insurance are managed through a third-party provider in accordance with local regulations. The EMS system works closely with this provider to ensure accurate billing and compliance with insurance requirements, helping maintain financial sustainability while continuing to deliver high-quality care.</p>

    <h2>Future Challenges and Goals</h2>
    <h3>Anticipated Challenges</h3>
    <p>The EMS system faces emerging challenges, including population growth, potential natural disasters, and evolving regulatory requirements. Currently, the system does not regularly conduct large-scale drills, aside from the <strong>Tri-Annual Airport Drill</strong> (FAA requirement) and occasional <strong>active shooter exercises</strong> in coordination with the Sheriff's Office and the School District. Drills with the counties covered by mutual aid agreements are not regularly conducted, which may limit cross-agency collaboration and preparedness for large-scale incidents.</p>

    <h3>Long-Term Vision</h3>
    <p>Over the next 5-10 years, the EMS system aims to:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Build <strong>3 additional stations</strong> to enhance coverage and response time.</li>
        <li>Expand the <strong>available training</strong> provided for personnel to improve skillsets and readiness.</li>
        <li>Improve <strong>QA/QI processes</strong> to ensure higher standards of patient care and performance.</li>
        <li>Implement <strong>new medical direction, protocols</strong>, and updated <strong>equipment</strong> such as <strong>ventilators</strong> and <strong>IV pumps</strong> to ensure cutting-edge service delivery.</li>
        <li>Expand the <strong>FTO program</strong>, adding more field training officers to meet increasing demands for quality mentorship and training.</li>
        <li>Add <strong>roaming EMS supervision</strong> to ensure better oversight and operational efficiency across the system.</li>
        <li>Establish an <strong>EMS Special Operations Team</strong> (Critical Care Unit) to handle high-acuity patients requiring specialized care and transportation.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>This EMS system operates across a large geographical area with a dedicated team working on a 24-hour on/48-hour off shift schedule. Despite challenges such as population growth and response delays in some areas, the system is working to improve operational efficiency, quality assurance, and patient care standards. The system is poised for growth, with plans for additional stations, expanded training, and increased specialization, all aimed at addressing future challenges and improving the overall effectiveness of emergency medical services for the community.</p>
